# issue-prioritizer

This is a GitHub App built with [probot](https://probot.github.io/). It sets priority for github issues based on potential, weight and effort metrics. Here is a blogpost that describes in details the idea and reasons behind it: [Backlog Priority Automation using Github Apps](http://techblog.holidaycheck.com/post/2018/04/11/metrics-priority).

## Setup

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run test
npm test

# Run the bot
npm start

# Run the bot in dev mode with hot reload
npm dev:start
```
